### Description:
This Python script captures real-time audio from a microphone, performs noise reduction, and transcribes the speech using OpenAI's Whisper model. The transcription process is designed to handle silent periods and avoid unnecessary processing. The code leverages the PyAudio library for audio input, NumPy for data manipulation, and the Noisereduce library to improve transcription accuracy by reducing background noise.

**Features:**
- Real-time audio capture using PyAudio
- Noise reduction using the Noisereduce library
- Speech transcription using the Whisper model from OpenAI
- Dynamic handling of silent periods to optimize performance
- Robust error handling for audio input overflow and stream closure

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.x
- PyAudio
- NumPy
- Whisper (from OpenAI)
- Noisereduce

**Setup and Usage:**
1. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pyaudio numpy whisper noisereduce
    ```
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python real_time_transcription.py
    ```
3. Speak into the microphone. The script will print the transcribed text.

**Note:**
- Ensure your microphone is properly set up and accessible by PyAudio.
- Adjust the `SILENCE_THRESHOLD` and `BUFFER_SIZE` parameters if needed for better performance based on your environment.
